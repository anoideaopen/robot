| 3.  | The number of unique participants is up to 100 (only legal entities).                                                                                                                                                                                     | Microservices                                                    |
| 4.  | The Platform supports a maximum of 50 channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Multichannel                                                     |
| 5.  | The System shall be able to support up to 1000 concurrent users on-peak. If this threshold is exceeded (more than 1000 users), degradation of productivity is acceptable depending on the priority of the process within which the user performs actions. | Microservices, HLF distributed architecture, Cloud, Multichannel |
| 6.  | The Platform must ensure that the speed parameters are independent of the number of tokens simultaneously issued on the Platform.                                                                                                                         | Microservices, Multichannel                                      |
| 7.  | The Platform must meet the requirements of a decentralized public blockchain project with ability to maintain private network segments.                                                                                                                   | Multichannel; Private channel                                    |
| 8.  | The Platform must allow to hide information for the specified tokens:<ul><li>about the contents of the transaction;</li><li>about the state of variables in the blockchain State;</li></ul>                                                               | Multichannel, Private channel                                    |
| 9.  | When enabling the "hide information for a given token" mode, the Platform must provide access to all hidden information to regulators or other appropriate authorities.                                                                                   | Multichannel; Private channel                                    |
| 10. | The Platform should offer developers tools that provide inter-channel interaction, or, in other words, interaction between issued tokens.                                                                                                                 | Atomic swap                                                      |
| 11. | The Platform must allow to archive the information about a Token at the end of its life cycle without violating the integrity of the Platform.                                                                                                            | Multichannel                                                     |
| 12. | All administrative actions for configuring the Blockchain network are performed by the security officer of the Platform.                                                                                                                                  |                                                                  |
